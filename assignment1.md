**Clarity and Accuracy**

# Critique

**Clarity and Access 4.5/5**

* Insight: Many DC tenants are being evicted yearly and are not getting the proper notice to show up in court.

* Headline: The headline was clear and precise; straight to the point.  

* Navigation: The article was very wordy. Very easy for readers to be overwhelmed and lose interest in the first 2 paragraphs. 

* Navigation Improvements: Make a chart for the statistics of DC residents being evicted yearly instead of repeating it all throughout the article.

**Data Visuals N/A**

* Article did not have any 

**Data accuracy 4/5**

* Questions: Some of the article's sources can be seen as questionable. They scoured themselves at times, papers, and some of the websites may look sketchy to the public.

* Suggestions: Find more well known and credible websites to back up their claims.

* Source Provided: Many sources that are highlighted all throughout the article such as Princeton Universityâ€™s Eviction Lab, affidavits, and many more.

* Accurate Explanation: Yes, they explained everything that needed to be explained such as the legal processes.

**Quality 4/5**

* Execution: Clear and concise all throughout the article. Uses data to strengthen their claims while using real peoples quotes to make the article feel more personal to the residents in DC.

* Improvement: Using charts, bar plots, and other visual statistics to make their evidence more visual for the reader to understand.

**Creativity 2/5**

* Effectiveness: Lack of creativity. Only used some visuals and a video to highlight the article.
